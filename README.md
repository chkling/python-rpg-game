TEAM MONGOOSE PYTHON RPG GAME

Introduction:

Our team was inspired to make a mongoose vs. python battle simulator to demonstrate our conquering of the Python coding language.

How it works:

The player takes control of a mongoose who has encountered a python in the wilderness. As the mongoose, the player has a menu of options to choose from in battle. The player can use two attacks, restore health by eating a berry, view health and attempt to run away. The python will be attacking back, so the player must choose their options wisely.

Functionality:

The game flows under a function containing a while/if loop. Classes for the python and mongoose have both been imported. They contain methods for the various attacks, taking damage and other results from the menu option selected. Depending on the selected option from the main menu and health of the animals, it will continue to loop until one of the fight_result function conditions are met by either animal reaching zero health points.
